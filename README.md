# Force-Sensitive-Mat

This repository includes code to drive a circuit involving an Arduino UNO and two 8:1 Mux. The Arduino Sketch is purely for data computation. The MATLAB code generates an 8\*8 heatmap to see where and how much force was applied on the mat. Interfacing through the Arduino IDE is comparatively faster than using MATLAB.
